# ShakeSearch Challenge

Welcome to the Pulley Shakesearch Challenge! This repository contains a simple web app for searching text in the complete works of Shakespeare.

## Prerequisites

To run the tests, you need to have Go and Docker installed on your system.

## Your Task

Your task is to fix the underlying code to make the failing tests in the app pass. There are 3 frontend tests and 3 backend tests, with 2 of each currently failing. You should not modify the tests themselves, but rather improve the code to meet the test requirements. You can use the provided Dockerfile to run the tests or the app locally. The success criteria are to have all 6 tests passing.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository.
2. Fix the underlying code to make the tests pass.
3. Open a pull request, which will run the tests through GitHub Actions. Ensure all tests pass.
4. Email us back with a short explanation of the process of making the tests pass by improving the code.

## Running the App Locally

```bash
make run
```

## Running the Tests

```bash
make test
```

Good luck!
